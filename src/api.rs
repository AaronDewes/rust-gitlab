//! API endpoint structures
//!
//! The types in this module are meant to aid in constructing the appropriate calls using type-safe
//! Rust idioms.
//!
//! All endpoints use the builder pattern and have their members as private so that there are no
//! API implications of adding new members for additional query parameters in future GitLab
//! releases.
